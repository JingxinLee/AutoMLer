# To accomplish the task of classifying images into one of 10 categories using the ResNet-50 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, 
# you can follow the code snippet below. This code snippet assumes that you are using PyTorch and the torchvision library to access the ResNet-50 model and the CIFAR-10 dataset.


# Step 1: Import the necessary libraries and modules
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision.models import resnet50
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torch import nn, optim
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Step 2: Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
# CIFAR-10 is available directly in torchvision, so we don't need to use openml in this case
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)

# Step 3: Split the data into training and testing sets
# Since CIFAR-10 is already split into train and test, we can directly use them
trainloader = DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True, num_workers=2)
testloader = DataLoader(testset, batch_size=4, shuffle=False, num_workers=2)

# Step 4: Initialize the model
model = resnet50(pretrained=True)
num_ftrs = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10)  # CIFAR-10 has 10 classes

# Step 5: Train the model
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

for epoch in range(10):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)

        optimizer.zero_grad()

        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        running_loss += loss.item()
    print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, loss: {running_loss / len(trainloader)}')

print('Finished Training')

# Step 6: Make predictions on the testing set
correct = 0
total = 0
predictions = []
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in testloader:
        images, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)
        outputs = model(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        predictions.extend(predicted.cpu().numpy())
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

# Step 7: Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(testset.targets, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: {accuracy * 100}%')



# Please note that this code snippet is a basic example of how to train a ResNet-50 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. You may need to adjust hyperparameters, such as the learning rate or the number of epochs, to achieve better performance. Additionally, you might want to add more sophisticated data augmentation, learning rate scheduling, or other advanced techniques to improve the model's accuracy.
